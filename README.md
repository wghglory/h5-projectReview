## Build Setup

``` bash
yarn add node-sass sass-loader --dev

# chromedriver is in package.json by default, but I removed it since yarn always has error with that.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
